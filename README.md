Cordova GoogleMaps plugin for iOS and Android
==========================
This plugin is a thin wrapper for [Google Maps Android API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/) and [Google Maps SDK for iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/).
Both [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) and [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/) are supported.

You can create map application that uses native Google Maps with JavaScript, which is faster than Google Maps JavaScript API v3.

----

There are two versions:

## v1.4.0 (current, but it's cold version)

You can create only one map in your application.
For documentation, read from [HERE](./v1.4.0/README.md)

## v2.0.0 (new version, but might be unstable)

You can create multiple maps in your application.
Many bugs are fixed, and many features are improved.
But it might be unstable sometimes.

Unfortunately, the documentation for v2.0 is not ready yet.
But the example app contains documentation and demo code.
