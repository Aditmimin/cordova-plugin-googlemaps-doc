# For ionic2 users

Thank you for using the cordova-googlemaps-plugin.

The cordova-googlemaps-plugin v2-beta is in public beta, the performance is improved.
The most of cases are no problem (I hope so).

However, if you use the [ionic-native-googlemaps](http://market.ionic.io/starters/google-maps) plugin with v2-beta version,
please watch your code.

The several method names and event names are changed in the v2-beta version.
Basically works the map, but you need to modify your code by yourself.

For more details, please read the [Migrate from v1 to v2](https://github.com/mapsplugin/cordova-plugin-googlemaps/wiki/Migrate-from-v1-to-v2) page.

Unfortunately, Masashi(@wf9a5m75) is not familiar with ionic.
So basically no support for the  [ionic-native-googlemaps](http://market.ionic.io/starters/google-maps) plugin.
